# PertDist
In my current job I work a fair amount with the Beta-PERT (or just PERT) distribution, but there's currently no implementation of this in scipy. To make up the deficency I crafted up my own PERT distribution class, leveraging numpy and scipy.

This class was developed in Python 3.7.4, though it *should* work on older versions of Python.

Installation is straightforward: `pip install pert`
